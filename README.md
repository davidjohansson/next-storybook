# Combined NextJS and Storybook

This is a demo repository for how you can combine a Storybook with a NextJS setup. This is not something that will work with snapshot testing of components out of the box for NextJS as of writing this README.

- NextJS used for all of the React setup.
- Storybook for a demo of the components.
- Snapshot testing with jest with CSS module.
- Storyshots to run tests on all of the stories in the storybook.
- Allows for using the components within the Next applicaiton.
